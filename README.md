# Project Description:  
This project collects data from the **Cucumber RS Gravitech ESP32-S2 WiFi Dev Board** equipped with sensors: **HTS221**, **BMP280**, and **MPU-6050**. While all three sensors are present, we focus only on data from **BMP280** (pressure) and **MPU-6050** (accelerometer and gyroscope) for our analysis of detecting movement changes, altitude variations, and accident occurrences using sensor fusion techniques. The system leverages accelerometer and barometric pressure sensors to provide accurate real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Sensor Data Overview  
The sensors provide the following measurements:

| Sensor    | Measurements                     | Data Type         |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| HTS221    | Humidity, Temperature           | $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}$ |
| BMP280    | Pressure                        | $\mathbb{R}$       |
| MPU-6050  | Accelerometer, Gyroscope        | $\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathbb{R}^3$ |

The full data vector $\overrightarrow{X_{all}}$ is a $1 \times 9$ vector:  

$$
\overrightarrow{X_{all}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Humidity} & \text{Temperature} & \text{Pressure} & \text{Accelerometer} & \text{Gyroscope} \\
\in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R}^3 & \in \mathbb{R}^3
\end{bmatrix}_{1 \times 9}
$$

However, we reduce this to a $1 \times 7$ feature vector $\vec{X}$ for our analysis, excluding humidity and temperature from HTS221:  

$$
\vec{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Pressure} & \text{Accelerometer} & \text{Gyroscope} \\
\in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R}^3 & \in \mathbb{R}^3
\end{bmatrix}_{1 \times 7}
$$

Where:  
- **Pressure**: Scalar value ($\mathbb{R}$).  
- **Accelerometer**: Vector ($[a_{x},a_{y}, a_{z}] \in \mathbb{R}^3$).  
- **Gyroscope**: Vector ($[\omega_{x}, \omega_{y}, \omega_{z}] \in \mathbb{R}^3$).  

Thus, $\vec{X} \in \mathbb{R}^7$ represents the feature vector used as input for anomaly detection. The train and test sets will be labeled based on real experiments conducted during hiking scenarios.

- **Input**: $\vec{X} \in \mathbb{R}^7$  
- **Output**: $Y \in GF(2)$ (i.e., $\{0, 1\}$), where:  
  - $Y = 0$: Normal movement  
  - $Y = 1$: Anomalous movement  

The Deep learning model is expressed as:  

$$
MLP(\vec{X}) = Y
$$


### Physical Interpretation  
The sensor data can be physically interpreted as:  
- **Pressure** $\mapsto$ **Height (Altitude)**: Pressure decreases with increasing altitude, enabling height tracking.  
- **Accelerometer + Time** $\mapsto$ **Average Speed or Velocity**: Integrating acceleration over time provides velocity or speed estimates.  
- **Gyroscope** $\mapsto$ **Angular Velocity**: Measures rotational speed and orientation changes, useful for detecting turns or tilts.  

These interpretations support detecting movement changes, altitude variations, and sudden anomalies like falls.

# Objectives:  
1. **Movement Change Detection**: Utilize accelerometer data to monitor changes in movement patterns, including acceleration, deceleration, and directional shifts.  
2. **Pressure and Altitude Change Detection**: Use barometric pressure sensors to measure altitude variations, enabling detection of ascending or descending movements.  
3. **Accident Detection**: Identify sudden, irregular movement patterns indicative of accidents (e.g., falls or collisions).
4. **Data Fusion**: Combine data from both accelerometer and barometric sensors for more accurate and reliable event detection.
5. **Data Processing**: Process sensor data to provide alerts in case of detected anomalies.  

# Methodology:  
- **Data Collection**: Acquire raw data from the BMP280 (pressure) and MPU-6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope) via the ESP32-S2, published to an MQTT broker (`broker.emqx.io`) under topics like `brohiking/all`, `brohiking/pressure`, etc.  
- **Pre-processing**: Filter noise using a low-pass filter and calibrate sensor readings to account for environmental variations (e.g., temperature effects on pressure).  
- **Feature Extraction**: Calculate key features such as:  
  - Acceleration magnitude: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$  
  - Altitude change rate: Derived from pressure differences over time.  
  - Sudden movement spikes: Detected via gyroscope and accelerometer thresholds.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use real experimental data to label normal and anomalous patterns, with detection implemented via LINE Bot, LLM API, and a web app.  
- **Integration**: Fuse accelerometer and pressure data to enhance detection accuracy.  
- **Alert System**: Notify users through LINE Bot messages, leveraging an LLM API for intelligent analysis and a web app for visualization, upon detecting anomalies.

# User Stories:  
- As a hiker, I want to monitor altitude changes during my activity to track my climbing progress.  
- As a hiker, I want real-time alerts via LINE if I fall or experience an accident, so emergency help can be notified.  
- As an outdoor enthusiast, I want to analyze my movement patterns on a web app to improve my hiking performance.

# Expected Outcomes:  
- Accurate detection of movement changes and altitude variations with a resolution of ¬±1 meter for altitude and ¬±0.1 m/s¬≤ for acceleration.  
- Reliable accident detection with minimal false positives (target accuracy > 90%).  
- Real-time alert system delivering notifications within 5 seconds of an anomaly via LINE Bot.  
- Scalable solution for applications like personal safety devices, vehicle monitoring, or outdoor activity tracking.

# Implementation Details:  
- **ESP32 Setup**: The ESP32 collects sensor data every 5 seconds, formats it as JSON, and publishes it to MQTT topics (e.g., `brohiking/all`).

   - Use MQTT Explorer to subscribe to `brohiking/#`.  
   - Check Firebase Console for real-time updates.
