# Project Description:  
This project collects data from the **Cucumber RS Gravitech ESP32-S2 WiFi Dev Board** equipped with sensors: **HTS221**, **BMP280**, and **MPU-6050**. While all three sensors are present, we focus only on data from **BMP280** (pressure) and **MPU-6050** (accelerometer and gyroscope) for our analysis of detecting movement changes, altitude variations, and accident occurrences using sensor fusion techniques. The system leverages accelerometer and barometric pressure sensors to provide accurate real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Sensor Data Overview  
The sensors provide the following measurements:

| Sensor    | Measurements                     | Data Type         |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| HTS221    | Humidity, Temperature           | $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}$ |
| BMP280    | Pressure                        | $\mathbb{R}$       |
| MPU-6050  | Accelerometer, Gyroscope        | $\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathbb{R}^3$ |

The full data vector $\overrightarrow{X_{all}}$ is a $1 \times 9$ vector:  

$$
\overrightarrow{X_{all}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Humidity} & \text{Temperature} & \text{Pressure} & \text{Accelerometer} & \text{Gyroscope} \\
\in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R}^3 & \in \mathbb{R}^3
\end{bmatrix}_{1 \times 9}
$$

However, we reduce this to a $1 \times 7$ feature vector $\vec{X}$ for our analysis, excluding humidity and temperature from HTS221:  

$$
\vec{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Pressure} & \text{Accelerometer} & \text{Gyroscope} \\
\in \mathbb{R} & \in \mathbb{R}^3 & \in \mathbb{R}^3
\end{bmatrix}_{1 \times 7}
$$
Where:  
- **Pressure**: Scalar value ($\mathbb{R}$).  
- **Accelerometer**: Vector ($[a_{x},a_{y}, a_{z}] \in \mathbb{R}^3\mapsto \left \lVert a \right \rVert_{2} = \sqrt{a^2_{x}+a^2_{y}+a^2_{z}}\in \mathbb{R}$ ).  
- **Gyroscope**: Vector ($[\omega_{x}, \omega_{y}, \omega_{z}] \in \mathbb{R}^3\mapsto \left \lVert \omega \right \rVert_{2} = \sqrt{\omega^2_{x}+\omega^2_{y}+\omega^2_{z}}\in \mathbb{R}$).  

Thus, $\vec{X} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ represents the feature vector used as input for anomaly detection. The train and test sets are labeled based on real experiments conducted during hiking scenarios.

### Input & Output  

- **Input**:  $\Delta\vec{X}' \in \mathbb{R}^3$ , where the features are:  
  - $\Delta \left \lVert a \right \rVert_{2}$
  - $\Delta \left \lVert \omega \right \rVert_{2}$
  - $\Delta P$   

- **Output**:
  - $Y = 1$ : Normal movement  
  - $Y = -1$: Anomalous movement  

### Model Rationale and Approach  

Due to the large volume of data collected from experiments, we use the Unsupervised Learning: **Isolation Forest** algorithm for anomaly detection. This method is effective at identifying suspicious movements by isolating data points that exhibit unusual characteristics. Specifically, the model detects anomalies based on **changes in acceleration, angular velocity, and pressure readings**.

Pressure changes are particularly significant in our approach:  
- A **decrease** in pressure suggests a possible **altitude drop** or **abnormal movement**, which could indicate an anomaly.  
- An **increase** in pressure is considered **normal** and does not trigger an alert.  

Mathematically, the model is expressed as:  

$$IF(\Delta \vec{X}) = Y$$

where the decision function score determines if an anomaly is detected. If the score is negative, the movement is considered **anomalous**, triggering an alert.  


### Physical Interpretation  
The sensor data can be physically interpreted as:  
- **Pressure** $\mapsto$ **Height (Altitude)**: Pressure decreases with increasing altitude, enabling height tracking.  
- **Accelerometer + Time** $\mapsto$ **Average Speed or Velocity**: Integrating acceleration over time provides velocity or speed estimates.  
- **Gyroscope** $\mapsto$ **Angular Velocity**: Measures rotational speed and orientation changes, useful for detecting turns or tilts.  

These interpretations support detecting movement changes, altitude variations, and sudden anomalies like falls.

# Objectives:  
1. **Movement Change Detection**: Utilize accelerometer data to monitor changes in movement patterns, including acceleration, deceleration, and directional shifts.  
2. **Pressure and Altitude Change Detection**: Use barometric pressure sensors to measure altitude variations, enabling detection of ascending or descending movements.  
3. **Accident Detection**: Identify sudden, irregular movement patterns indicative of accidents (e.g., falls or collisions).
4. **Data Fusion**: Combine data from both accelerometer and barometric sensors for more accurate and reliable event detection.
5. **Data Processing**: Process sensor data to provide alerts in case of detected anomalies.  

# Methodology:  
- **Data Collection**: Acquire raw data from the BMP280 (pressure) and MPU-6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope) via the ESP32-S2, published to an MQTT broker (`broker.emqx.io`) under topics like `brohiking/all`, `brohiking/pressure`, etc.  
- **Pre-processing**: Filter noise using a low-pass filter and calibrate sensor readings to account for environmental variations (e.g., temperature effects on pressure).  
- **Feature Extraction**: Calculate key features such as:  
  - Acceleration magnitude
  - Angular velocity magnitude  
  - Pressure Change
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use real experimental data train anomalies pattern with **Isolation Forest** 
- **Integration**: Fuse accelerometer and pressure data to enhance detection accuracy.  
- **Alert System**: Notify users through LINE Bot messages.

# User Stories:  
- As a hiker, I want to monitor altitude changes during my activity to track my climbing progress.  
- As a hiker, I want real-time alerts via LINE if I fall or experience an accident, so emergency help can be notified.  
- As an outdoor enthusiast, I want to analyze my movement patterns on a web app to improve my hiking performance.

# Expected Outcomes:  
- Accurate detection of movement changes and altitude variations.
- Real-time alert system delivering notifications of an anomaly via LINE Bot.  
- Scalable solution for applications like personal safety devices, vehicle monitoring, or outdoor activity tracking.
