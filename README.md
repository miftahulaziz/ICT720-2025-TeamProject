# Project Title
Movement and Accident Detection System using Sensor Fusion

<img src="" alt="alt text" width="400">

# Project Description:
This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of detecting movement changes, altitude variations, and accident occurrences using sensor fusion techniques. The system leverages accelerometer and barometric pressure sensors to provide accurate real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.

# Objectives:
1. **Movement Change Detection:** Utilize accelerometer data to monitor changes in movement patterns, including acceleration, deceleration, and directional shifts.
2. **Altitude Change Detection:** Use barometric pressure sensors to measure altitude variations, enabling detection of ascending or descending movements.
3. **Accident Detection:** Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify sudden, irregular movement patterns indicative of accidents (e.g., falls or collisions).
4. **Real-time Data Processing:** Process sensor data in real-time to provide immediate alerts in case of detected anomalies.
5. **Data Fusion:** Combine data from both accelerometer and barometric sensors for more accurate and reliable event detection.

# Methodology:
- Data Collection: Acquire raw data from accelerometer and barometric sensors.
- Pre-processing: Filter noise and calibrate sensor readings.
- Feature Extraction: Identify key features such as acceleration magnitude, altitude change rate, and sudden movement spikes.
- Anomaly Detection: Apply machine learning or rule-based algorithms to detect abnormal movement patterns.
- Integration: Fuse data from both sensors to enhance detection accuracy.
- Alert System: Notify users through mobile applications or cloud platforms upon detecting accidents.

# User Stories:
1. As a user, I want the system to detect sudden falls so that I can receive immediate emergency alerts.
2. As a hiker, I want to monitor altitude changes during my activity to track my climbing progress.
3. As a parent, I want to monitor my child's activity to ensure they are safe during outdoor play.
4. As a delivery rider, I want accident alerts to be sent to my emergency contacts in case of unexpected incidents.
5. As a cyclist, I want movement irregularities to be detected to improve my personal safety during rides.

# Expected Outcomes:
- Accurate detection of movement changes and altitude variations.
- Reliable accident detection with minimal false positives.
- Real-time alert system to improve user safety.
- Scalable solution for various applications such as personal safety devices, vehicle monitoring, or outdoor activity tracking.

# Tools and Technologies:
- Accelerometer and Barometric Pressure Sensors (e.g., MPU-6050, BMP280)
- Microcontroller Platform (e.g., ESP32, Arduino)
- Data Processing Algorithms (e.g., Kalman Filter, Machine Learning Models)
- Mobile Application for Notifications
- Cloud Integration for Data Storage and Alerts
